Inventory Management Project

Endpoints - define the whole CRUD operations that can be performed on Product entities:

- GET /docs - OpenAPI documentation (generated by FastAPI)
- GET /product - list all available products
- POST /product - create a new product
- PATCH /product/{name} - update quantity to an existing product
- DELETE /product/{product_name} - delete an existing product

Project structure:
* app.py: initialization of FastAPI and all the routes used by the API. 
    - product_create.py: model used as POST request body. Includes all the fields from the Update model.
    - product_read.py: model used as GET response body. Includes all the fields from the Create model, plus the id (which comes from the _id field in Mongo document) 
* database.py: initialization of MongoDB client. 
* repositories.py: methods that interact with the Mongo database to read or write Product data. 
* settings.py: load of application settings

assumptions:
* Because there is no product_id in the product structure that written in the requirements, the name is the unique key.
* Category is a list of values, i didn't do any validation on this field.
* Update can be only on the quantity field so i used patch instead of put.

using API instructions:
* db_initialize.py - file with data to initialize the DB.
* for using the api go to localhost:8000
